# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Fixes
Changed the code to add HTML semantics so it was easier to read in the html. Added a new classes in the HTML so we can get rid of the triplicate code in the css

Notes are commented in both HTML and CSS for further information on what was actually changed

## Description
In this assignment we were given code in HTML and CSS. We had to first look at and decypher to code to see what portion interacted with what. By doing so we can there's an unnesscary amount divs and we had to change those with the proper the HTML semantics. In the CSS we had to change divs to their proper semantic HTML, but by scrolling further down you'll notice that there was multiple lines of code that were basically the same and interacted the same. So we had to create a class that would fit for each line of extra code, deleting multiple lines of unnesscary code.
